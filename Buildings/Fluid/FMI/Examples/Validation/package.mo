This package contains validation models for the classes in
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.FMI.Examples\">
Buildings.Fluid.FMI.Examples
</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note that most validation models contain simple input data
or systems which may not be realistic, but are useful
to validate that the models are implemented correctly.
These model outputs are stored as reference data and
used for continuous validation whenever models in the library change.
