This package contains models that validate the blocks in
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Experimental.OpenBuildingControl.CDL.Conversion\">
Buildings.Experimental.OpenBuildingControl.CDL.Conversion</a>.
</p>
<p>
The examples plot various outputs, which have been verified against
analytical solutions. These model outputs are stored as reference data to
allow continuous validation whenever models in the library change.
